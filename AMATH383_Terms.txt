\textbf{Terms}
\varrho - radius of a ball
z - center of a sphere
\textbf{z} - set of balls, or state in $\mathbb{R}^m$
$\zeta_{ij}$ - signed distance between centers of two intersecting spheres
\sigma - fraction of solvent-exposed surface for two intersecting spheres
\beta - fraction of solvent-exposet surface for three intersecting spheres
\alpha - atomic solvation parameter
B - Ball, or atom. Example: $B_i$ is a set of of balls with radius \varrho_i and center $z_i$, where $0<=i<=n-1$
S - Sphere, where $S_i$ is the sphere that bounds $B_i$.
f - map taking \textbf{z} from $\mathbb{R}^m$ to $\mathbb{R}$
F - space filling diagrram
$\pi_i(x)$ - The power distance of a random point x from $S_i$, which depends on the radius of $B_i$.
$P_i$ - The power cells of $S_i$ which minimizes the power discance between two or more spheres.
K - dual complex of Delaunay Triangulation. Consists of all power cells with non-empty intersection.
\textbf{u} - gradient vector
\textbf{t} - variable velocity vector
C - Cap, i.e. where $C_{ij}$ contains all the points in the intersection of $B_i$ and $S_j$
$DA_\textbf{z}$ - Weighted area derivative at \textbf{z}, which has a gradient vector \textbf{a} and variable vector \textbf{t}
$DE_\textbf{z}$ - Weighted area derivative at \textbf{z}, which has a gradient vector \textbf{e} and variable vector \textbf{t}
